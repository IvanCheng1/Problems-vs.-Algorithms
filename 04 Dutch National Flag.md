# Dutch National Flag Problem

* Given an input array consisting on only 0, 1, and 2, sort the array in a *single traversal*. You're not allowed to use any sorting function that Python provides.

### Explanation
* a for loop is used to loop the numbers in the input list
* if number is 0, 1, or 2, number is appended to appropriate output number list
* returns concatenated output number lists

### Time efficiency
* O(n)
* one for loop

### Space efficiency
* O(n)
* depends on size on input
