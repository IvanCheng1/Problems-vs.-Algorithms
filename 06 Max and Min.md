# Max and Min in a Unsorted Array

* In this problem, we will look for smallest and largest integer from a list of unsorted integers. The code should run in O(n) time. Do not use Python's inbuilt functions to find min and max.

* **Bonus Challenge**: find the max and min in a single traversal.

### Explanation
* a for loop is used to loop the numbers in the input list
* if number is bigger / smaller than the previous number, update the output big / small variables in a single traversal

### Time efficiency
* O(n)
* one for loop

### Space efficiency
* O(n)
* the entire input list is compared
